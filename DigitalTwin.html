							<h1>Digital Twins for Healthcare</h1>
							<hr />
							<p>With origins tied to <a href="https://www.sap.com/blogs/digital-twins-at-work">the Apollo 13 mission</a> and modern uses cases spanning everything from <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogcacm/the-power-of-digital-twins-in-cybersecurity/">cyber warfare</a> to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11736137/">surgical rehearsal</a>, digital twins have developed a reputation that’s part engineering marvel, part boardroom buzzword. The truth? Probably a bit of both, but there is some real innovation that's worth exploring.</p>
							<p>At face value, the concept of a digital twin refers to a virtual representation of a physical object, wherein the digital model is used to understand, predict, and optimize the performance of its real-world counterpart. For some actual context, consider a few of the use cases that <a href="https://www.sap.com/blogs/digital-twins-at-work">SAP</a> recently highlighted:</p> 
							<!--<p>Which, admittedly, does sound a bit like a marketing term for <i>'some model'</i>, but nevertheless, consider a few of the real-world Digital Twin use cases</p> -->
							<blockquote>BMW’s digital twin factories support sustainability, efficiency, and digital transformation goals
							<br>Thames Water plugs leaks with a replica of its water supply network
							<br>Battling rising tides, South Pacific nation Tuvalu taps digital twins in face of existential climate threat
							<br>GE Vernova gets more power with digital wind farms</blockquote>
							<p>And that's just a few off-the-shelf examples - a short google search around '<i>digital twin + [insert your favorite industry or subject]</i>' will almost certainly reveal a litany of articles and thought pieces. Skimming <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-forward/digital-twins-when-and-why-to-use-one">McKinsey's</a> take on the matter, it's clear digital twins aren't just for engineers - it almost feels like you've stepped into a Bond movie, with references to racing sailboats, luxury cars, oil rigs, posh hotels and train stations.</p>
							<p>So, the question then becomes: if we can build digital wind turbines and simulate years of wear-and-tear across different weather patterns to anticipate defects and predict maintenance needs, what can we do in healthcare? Exploring the answer to that was the genesis of this white paper, where I review how different interventions - such as boosting daily steps or changing household income - might influence an invidual's diabetes risk score. <s>A far cry from MI6, no doubt, so let's deem this one <em>For Your Eyes Only.</em> </s> <span style="font-size: 0.6em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...terrible joke redacted.</span> </p>
							<!--<p>Some of the more inspiring, clinically focused uses cases I've stumbled upon include:
							<li><b>Surgical Practice:</b> Using medical imaging to construct digital replicas of a patient's anatomy for simulated surgery. Why rehearse with <em>a heart</em> when you can simulate with <em>the heart</em>?</li>
							<li><b>Epidemiological Modeling:</b> Using digital twins to simulate contagion outbreaks and R0 rates.</li>
